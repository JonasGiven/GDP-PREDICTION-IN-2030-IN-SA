This project aims to investigate the correlation between historical pass rates and GDP growth from 1995 to 2023. By analyzing these trends, the project seeks to develop a predictive model that can estimate future GDP changes based on variations in educational pass rates. Specifically, it aims to predict the impact on GDP if the pass rate increases by 10% by 2030.\n"

However, quantifying this relationship poses a challenge due to the myriad of influencing factors. This project leverages historical data on pass rates and GDP from 1995 to 2023 to explore this relationship in a structured and empirical manner. By employing machine learning techniques, the project will provide insights into how improvements in education can translate into economic gains. This analysis will aid policymakers and stakeholders in making informed decisions to foster both educational and economic advancements."

For the pass rate, the minimum was 47.40%, with Q1 at 61.43%, a median of 69.60%, Q3 at 75.27%, and a maximum of 81.30%. This shows a generally high pass rate, with most values clustered around the median to upper quartile range. For GDP, the minimum was \\$129.09 billion, Q1 was \\$171.05 billion, the median was \\$326.67 billion, Q3 was \\$392.22 billion, and the maximum was $458.20 billion. The GDP values indicate significant economic growth over the years, with a wide range from the lower quartile to the maximum. These observations suggest a positive correlation where higher pass rates are associated with higher GDP, reflecting the potential impact of education on economic performance."

        "My analysis reveals a clear correlation between South Africa’s GDP and the official matric pass rate over the years. When the pass rate increases, the GDP also tends to rise, and when the pass rate drops, the GDP tends to fall. For instance, from around 1998 to 2003, there was a significant increase in the pass rate, accompanied by a rise in GDP. However, from 2003 to 2010, the pass rate declined sharply, which slowed the GDP growth. Conversely, from 2009 to 2014, we observed a sharp increase in the pass rate, and the GDP grew as well. This pattern continues, with the pass rate drop in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19 causing a slight decrease in GDP. These trends suggest a strong link between educational outcomes and economic performance in South Africa."
